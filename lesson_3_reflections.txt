When you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I think you basically want to do this if you are working collaborately in the same repository with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you commit when changes are logical ang meaningful, maybe you are working collaborately with other colleagues on Github while working on the files locally on your computer. You dont want Git to sync manually to Github because you might not be ready to save those commits.
